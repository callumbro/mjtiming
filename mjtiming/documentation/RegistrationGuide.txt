SASC / M&J Timing Registration Procedure
see http://members.shaw.ca/MJ-Timing, then mjtiming-setup.docx

on a computer with internet access, go to "www.motorsportreg.com" (MSR) in your browser
click on "Organizers" (top right)
sign in as SASC with password as given by someone in authority
check to make sure the event is marked as Closed
click on "Registrations" (top right-ish of event header)
click on "Reports" (top right)
under "My Saved Reports", click on "M&JTiming report"; remember the number of registrations
click on "Export" (middle of header)
choose "Comma-separated values (CSV)", then click on "Export Report"
a file will be created in c:\tmp named yyyymmdd-MJTimingreport.csv;
    bring up this file and check that the number of lines matches the earlier count
    (if not, delete this file and repeat the export until it does)
click on "Logout" (top-most right)
if you haven't performed the above on the club timing computer,
    transfer the file over to it (we use a "zip" drive)

the remainder MUST be done on the club timing computer

bring up MJTiming using the desktop icon; make it full-screen
click on "Registration"
click on "Clear notes" then "Yes"
click on "Unregister all drivers" then "Yes"
click on "Import from MSR"
find the file exported above, click on it, then click "Open"
click (again) on "Unregister all drivers" then "Yes"

Notes:
- you MUST clear the Notes column BEFORE you load the new Export file - it is
  populated from the MSR registrations with who has paid and how much
  (clear it out from the last event, and it gets re-populated from the Export file
  for the current event)
- you MUST "Unregister all drivers" AFTER you load the new Export file, since we
  want it to ONLY be set during on-site registration for those people who actually
  show up, in order to correctly balance the run groups
- the Exported data is ADDED TO (not replaces completely) the data already in the database

all of the above can be done any time from when MSR registration closes
    until on-site registration closes

when on-site registration opens:

bring up MJTiming using the desktop icon; make it full-screen
as each person arrives to check in, have them
- sign the waiver (also Parental Consent and Minor Participant, if appropriate)
- submit their self-tech form
- present their driver's license
- if wanting/claiming member prices, present their proof of membership
look them up in the list
if they are there, verify ALL the data columns; if they are there more than
    once but with slight differences (e.g. case; nick-name), ask them to be
    consistent when registering since their placement in the overall standings
    will be separate for each one (e.g. Jens-Timothy Hoffman sometimes appears
    as Tim Hoffman; there is a James Callaghan Jr and Sr)
if they are NOT there, click on "Add driver" and fill in all required columns
    and all optional columns they wish to contribute (good task for a second
    registration person)
column by column:
- Number - required
  - must be unique for the event
  - any number of any characters ("26" is NOT the same as "026" nor "26A" nor "26000")
  - must match EXACTLY what they put on the car or timing cannot find them when recording
  - for a new driver, the default is the highest number so far plus 1
  - if the number is a duplicate of one already in the data, it will ask you if you want
    to use it anyway and who is using it - if you say to use it anyway, the other person's
    number will have an X appended (use your judgement - if the other person is coming,
    don't let them have it; if it's someone who comes regularly, don't let them have it;
    if it's someone you've never heard of, it's probably OK to let the new person have it;
    the registration database should be cleaned out at the start of each year)
  - it is expected that numbers less than 100 are for members only, and that numbers from
    100 to 199 are for co-drivers (of members)
  - if you want to be picky, SCCA rules say that a co-driver's car number must be at least
    100 greater than the first driver's number
- Preferred - optional - second choice of Number
  - try this new number first if there's a problem with using the first one
- Registered - required; yes/no
  - set this to "Yes" for this person
- Notes - required
  - if they paid on MSR, it will give the amount they paid
  - if it's a Member price, inspect their proof of membership
  - if it's $0.00, get the money from them (again, if they want Member price, inspect
    their proof of membership)
  - for 2016, prices are:
    pre-reg, member
    pre-reg, non-member
    on-site, member
    on-site, non-member
  - if it says "(new entry)" after the amount paid, it means this was this person's first
    time using MSR, so use extra care in verifying the data
- First Name - required
  - as entered / as they would enter on MSR (including case)
- Last Name - required
  - as entered / as they would enter on MSR (including case)
- WCMA - optional; yes/no
  - may or may not appear
  - are they a member of a WCMA-affiliated club or not
  - used for the WCMA race series to determine eligibility
- Member - required; yes/no
  - for members of SASC and/or CSCC ONLY
  - to determine elegibility for club championship awards
- Rookie - required; yes/no
  - to determine eligibility for club novice awards
  - SASC:  3 events (I think)
  - CSCC:  2 years (I think)
- Group - required
  - used to determine run groups
  - under the "Classes" tab, at the bottom, are the Groups (anything with a PAX of >= 1 except AM and AML)
  - see http://members.shaw.ca/MJ-Timing, then mjtiming-setup.docx
- Class - required
  - SCCA classing (see web)
  - for a given event, should the person drive more than one car,
    this must be the class with the worst/highest PAX number
  - must match EXACTLY what they put on the car
- Car Model - semi-required
  - year, make, model
  - some people drive more than one car
- Car Color [sic] - semi-required
  - what will a course worker say when calling in penalties
    (should they miss the car number)
- Tire - optional
  - SASC doesn't use
- Sponsor - optional
  - SASC doesn't use
- Fee - optional
  - SASC doesn't use
- Barcode - optional
  - SASC doesn't use
- Team - optional
  - SASC doesn't use

Notes:
- the registration tab works a lot like a spreadsheet, in that:
  - you can sort by any column simply by clicking on the column header
    (once for ascending, again for descending)
  - column width can be adjusted by dragging the column separator; but no column will
    ever disappear off the right (there is no left/right scrolling)
  - page up/down works as expected
  - home/end goes to first/last column for that line
- for yes/no columns, you can just type "y" or "n" (either case) and it will change it to
  "Yes" or "No" as soon as you exit the column
- Member price if they are a member this club or any associated club (e.g. WCMA, SCCA, CSCC)
- SCCA rules:  All cars must have car numbers and class letters on both sides. Car numbers
  will be a minimum of eight inches high and a minimum of 1-1/4 inch stroke. Class letter
  must be between 25% and 50% of the number size, no smaller than 3 inches high, and located
  adjacent to the numbers.  Color must be of adequate contrast to the car color.
- in order to delete a line, highlight the ENTIRE line using the pointer column, then hit the "Del" key
